    <p>Voter id is an important document. It was first paid out on the 21st but nothing yet. In the classic voter id card, you will get the epic number printed above the photo or behind the card. For voters that applied for and received the permanent exemption from showing a photo id based in their disability status, this status will be notated on their voter you will automatically receive a new certificate every two years if you haven&#039;t moved from the address at which you are registered.</p>
